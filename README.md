## ⚙️ How It Works
### 1. Input/Output Structure
- **Input**: Structured datasets or command-line inputs.
- **Output**: Computed results printed on the console or saved to files in the `data/` folder.

### 2. Core Modules
#### `main_module.py`
Handles the primary functionality of the project. It integrates all components, processes inputs, and generates outputs.

#### `utilities.py`
Contains reusable helper functions, including:
- Data parsing
- Mathematical computations
- Logging utilities

#### `test_cases.py`
Defines and executes unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.
